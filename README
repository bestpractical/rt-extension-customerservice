DESCRIPTION
    One common use for Request Tracker (RT) is tracking customer issues,
    typically related to customer service. "Customer Service" is often a
    department, either a designated department with many agents for large
    organizations, or sometimes only one or two people who handle all
    customer service for a smaller organization.

    RT is used to track incoming customer service requests so they don't get
    lost and can be assigned to individual people to handle. It's also
    useful for gathering general reporting on the volume of customer service
    requests and what types of problems seem to generate the most requests.

    This extension provides an initialdata
    <https://docs.bestpractical.com/rt/latest/initialdata.html/> file to
    configure a queue with some sensible default rights configuration for a
    typical customer service department. Once installed, you can then edit
    the configuration to best suit your needs.

  Service Queue
    After installing, you'll see a new queue called Service for tracking all
    of the incoming customer service requests. You can change the name to
    anything you like after installing. In a typical configuration, you will
    also want to assign an RT email address, like service@example.com or
    cs@example.com to create tickets in this queue.

  User Groups
    Three new user groups are added to handle different aspects of customer
    service: Service Representatives, Service Engineers, and Service
    Managers.

    Service Representatives are the front line of the customer service
    department and will handle the requests as they come into the system.

    Service Engineers assist the Service Representatives when an issue
    requires a high level of product knowledge.

    Service Managers review requests to ensure the customer needs are being
    met and also to track how many requests are coming in, and what is
    generating those requests.

  Rights
    Some typical initial rights are set on the Service queue. The system
    group "Everyone" gets a default set of rights to allow customers to
    create tickets. Everyone is a system group provided with RT, and as the
    name implies it encompasses every user in RT.

    oup_rights.png" alt="Group rights for 'Everyone' group on 'Service'
    queue" /></p>

    These rights are usually the minimum needed for a typical customer
    service department. Anyone is able to write into your customer service
    address with a customer service request, and they can reply and
    follow-up on that request if you send them some questions.

    The extension also grants "ShowTicket" to the Requestor role. If your
    end users have access to RT's self service interface, this allows them
    to see only tickets where they are the Requestor, which should be the
    tickets they opened.

    Your staff users will need many more rights to work on tickets. To make
    it easy to add and remove access for staff users, this extension creates
    three new groups: Service Representatives, Service Engineers, and
    Service Managers.

    Rights are granted to these groups, so membership in the group is all a
    user needs to get those rights.

    Service Representatives and Service Engineers are granted a set of
    rights to allow them to manage the incoming tickets and make changes to
    the tickets as required.

    Service Managers are granted a set of rights to view tickets but not
    make any changes to the tickets.

  Service Lifecycle
    RT allows you to create and configure custom workflows for each queue in
    the system. In RT a ticket workflow is known as a Lifecycle
    <https://docs.bestpractical.com/rt/latest/customizing/lifecycles.html>.
    This extension provies a custom lifecycle called "service" that defines
    the various statuses a ticket can be in.

  Custom Fields
    RT allows you to define custom fields on tickets, which can be anything
    you need to record and track. This extension provides some common to
    customer service: Customer, Severity, Product, Serial Number, and
    Warranty Required.

    Customer is an autocomplete type field, which means users can type in
    the box and if there is a defined value, it will autocomplete in a menu
    below the field. If the user needs to add a value that hasn't been used
    before, they can type in a completely new value. If you would prefer
    this to be a dropdown like Severity, you can change this in the admin
    section also.

    Severity is a dropdown with typical High, Medium, Low values. As an RT
    admin, you can change these values or add to them at Admin > Custom
    Fields, then click on Severity.

    Product is an autocomplete type field, which means users can type in the
    box and if there is a defined value, it will autocomplete in a menu
    below the field. If the user needs to add a value that hasn't been used
    before, they can type in a completely new value. If you would prefer
    this to be a dropdown like Severity, you can change this in the admin
    section also.

    Serial Number is a simple text field that will allow the user to type in
    a single value.

    Warranty Required is a dropdown with Yes or No values. As an RT admin,
    you can change these values or add to them at Admin > Custom Fields,
    then click on Warranty Required.

  Service Dashboard
    This extension creates a dashboard called "Service", accessible to any
    member of the Service Representative group. This dashboard has a default
    saved search called "Highest severity tickets waiting on customer
    service".

    As the name suggests, this saved search shows all tickets waiting for
    customer service and displays them in order by severity, so the most
    important will be at the top.

  Next Steps
    This extension provides a good starting point and you can start using it
    right away. Here are some additional things you can do to customize your
    configuration:

    *   Create new user accounts for other staff and add them to one of the
        new Groups. You might also remove the root user if that user account
        won't be involved in customer service.

    *   Update the custom fields by changing the values in the dropdowns or
        adding other custom fields that better fit your system.

    *   Edit your templates to customize the default messages you send to
        users. You can find templates at Admin > Global > Templates. For
        example, the "Autoreply in HTML" is the default template that goes
        to users when they open a ticket.

    *   Users working primarily in customer service can edit their
        preferences and set Service as their default queue.

    *   Users can select Reports > Update this menu and add the Service
        dashboard to their reports menu. The RT administrator can do this
        for all users as well.
